<div class="page">

<p>I am Lijun LI (李利君), a second year Ph.D. student in the department of Computer Science of <a href="https://www.cityu.edu.hk/" target="_blank">The City University of Hong Kong</a>. I am fortunate to have Professor <a href="https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~minmli/" target="_blank">Minming LI</a> as my advisor. I received my Bachelor degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics at <a href="http://www.ouc.edu.cn/main.htm" target="_blank">Ocean University of China</a> in June, 2021.</p>

<p>I’m interested in the intersection between computer science and economics such as algorithmic game theory, algorithmic fairness, computational social choice and incentives in machine learning.</p>
