<p>I am <a href="https://scholars.cityu.edu.hk/en/persons/lijun-li(c7e2e29a-8609-4536-bb72-73bb114a2af7).html" target="_blank">Lijun LI</a> (李利君). I get PhD degree from the department of Computer Science of <a href="https://www.cityu.edu.hk/" target="_blank">The City University of Hong Kong</a> in 2025. During PhD, I am fortunate to have Professor <a href="https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~minmli/" target="_blank">Minming LI</a> as my supervisor. I received my Bachelor degree in <a href="http://eweb.ouc.edu.cn/ms/main.htm" target="_blank"> Mathematics and Applied Mathematics </a> at <a href="http://www.ouc.edu.cn/main.htm" target="_blank">Ocean University of China</a> in June, 2021. I am on the job market now.</p>


<p>My research interests are related to the fields of artificial intelligence and theoretical computer science. I work on public resource allocation problems manifested in various scenarios such as machine learning, activity scheduling, and submodular function maximization. Besides research, I have great passion in teaching where I can guide and accompany students in the process of building deep understanding of the knowledge and appreciating it.</p>
